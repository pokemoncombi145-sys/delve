# Changelog

Newest first. The version is shown in the script window title (`Delve v3.6 | Brain`).

## v3.6: Index, Equipment, Stats and rare drops
**Added**
- **Index reader.** On launch it opens the T menu and reads every Index entry: name, zone, "1 in N" and whether you've found it. Entries scrolled out of view are read too, so it doesn't need to scroll.
- **Drop sources.** Outside a run, it selects each found entry it hasn't studied yet and reads which rocks drop it and how often (for example Field Stone 1 in 1.4, Copper Vein 1 in 33). Entries it has already studied are skipped on later launches.
- **Equipment reader.** Reads luck, power, damage and health, plus the selected item's power, swing speed, range and crit chance. It only reads this tab and never clicks in it, so it can't equip or sell anything.
- **Stats reader.** Reads your lifetime stats from the Stats tab.
- **Rare drop alerts on Discord.** Covers new Index entries, Epic tier or higher, anything at or above a "1 in N" threshold (500 by default), anything in the top % rarest of your Index (3% by default), and your own finds announced in Roblox chat (for example "1 out of 200,000"). Rare drops are also logged to `DelveDrops.jsonl`.
- **Gear memory.** Remembers mining radius and reach for each pickaxe and attack range for each sword. When you swap, it applies the known stats immediately and re-reads the game's numbers.
- **Run comparison by gear power.** Each run is scored against earlier runs made at a similar power, so upgrading your gear doesn't make relics from older runs look bad.
- The Discord run post now includes your gear stats and lifetime stats.
- Brain tab buttons: **Scan Index + Equipment now**, **Show index knowledge**.

**Changed**
- In combat, when it's already at the right distance from the target and there's nothing to dodge, it stands still and attacks instead of circling.
- Mining is unchanged: every rock is still mined. The Index is only used to judge how rare a drop is.

## v3.5: Accurate run results
- Depth and wave are read from the player list stats ("180 M" / "4 W") instead of guessed from on-screen text.
- Cash change uses the exact HUD counter ("$9,129,811,875") rather than the rounded "$9.13B".
- At the end of a run it waits for the **TRIP COMPLETE** screen to settle, then reads depth, cash value, rocks mined, XP, materials and level.
- Run scores and learning use those numbers.
- The Discord post title is now "Run Complete - Delve 50m" and adds trip value, cash change, rocks, XP, materials, level, time, outcome and % of time spent fighting.

## v3.4: Relic detection fix
- Ore-drop pop-ups ("Jade · 1 in 565 · x8") were being mistaken for relic cards and clicked.
- It now only looks for cards while "PICK A RELIC" is on screen, ignores anything containing "1 in N", and requires cards to be draft-sized.
- On load, the brain removes the fake relic entries it learned from those pop-ups (a one-time cleanup).

## v3.3: Relic picker speed
- When Roblox isn't focused or the menu is open, it clicks the card's button directly, so picks work while tabbed out.
- Relic picking keeps running even when Roblox stops drawing frames while tabbed out.
- It checks for a draft every 50 ms, waits less before clicking, and reads the countdown: with 3 s or less left it picks immediately, including relics it has never seen.
- The brain is saved after every pick and at the end of every run.

## v3.2: Fixes, Volt, GitHub
- Fixed "Malformed string" compile errors in the Brain tab.
- Added VirtualInputManager fallbacks for any input function an executor lacks (checked against Volt's API).
- The webhook helper defaults to Volt's workspace folder.
- Moved hosting to this repo.

## v3.1: Brain features
- **Relic codex.** Every relic seen is saved with its tier, effects and set. It learns which relics do well separately for Delve and wave runs, and learns combos.
- **Settings autosave** to `DelveSettings.json`. The farm switches itself back on if it was on when you left.
- **Smart targeting.** Ores first; it fights on boss stages, mob stages, when no ores are left, when a mob is close (learned distance) or when you're swarmed. Below the low-HP setting it stops chasing.
- **Discord "Run Complete" posts**, with a screenshot when `delve_webhook_helper.ps1` is running.
- **Run history** in `DelveRuns.jsonl`.

## v3.0: First version
- **Dodging.** Plans a path over the floor tiles out of attack zones, avoids corners and map edges, and routes around rocks and spots where it got stuck.
- **Learns from hits.** Adjusts its safety margin, learns each mob's real reach and tunes roll timing.
- **Relic picker that learns.** Reads tier, stats and sets, waits for the cards to settle before clicking, checks the click worked and retries another way if not.
